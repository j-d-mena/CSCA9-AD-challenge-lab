# CSCA9-AD-challenge-lab
this is to recreate the active directory challenge lab for CSCA9, however instead of using the GUI the challenge here is to do it through powershell only. Scenario is "In this challenge students utilize their acquired knowledge to modify an existing Active Directory Forest by installing a supporting domain controller in an Active Directory Site infrastructure simulating a routed wide area network of their own design. Additionally, DDNS infrastructure consisting of Primary and replicated Secondary zones were implemented by the students to support the expanded infrastructure"

# Tasks required to complete challenge
- [ ] Create new subnets 
- [ ] Create 3 new sites using AD sites

- [ ] Promote one server as an additional domain controller in the parent DNS namespace
- [ ] Promote server(s) as domain controller(s) creating a child domain in a different DNS namespace
